Instructions on how to run the Google Client API Authentication (in the folder)

1) Unzip the google_auth.rar into your current directory.

2) Add the Google Sign-In button on the home page, and redirect it to index.php located in this folder.

3) Make sure your IP address (localhost) is registered with the Google Developers Server (go to http://console.developers.google.com). If not, you will need to link your project to a registered OAuth Client ID and Client Secret.

4) Go to Credentials, click on Create Credentials, then click OAuth client ID. Use these credentials in the gpConfig.php file.

5) Click on the client ID link, then add http://localhost under Authorized JavaScript origins.

6) Next, add the following redirect URIs to the list of authorized redirect URIs:
	http://localhost/google_auth/index.php
	http://localhost/index.html
